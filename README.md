# dsi_capstone

I'm planning on doing my [General Assembly Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive) Capstone project on image recognition. Specifically, I am going to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images, automatically locating lung opacities on chest radiographs.  

This project is based on a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge).
