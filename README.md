# dsi_capstone

I'm planning on doing my [General Assembly Data Science Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive) Capstone project on image recognition. Specifically, I am going to build an algorithm to detect a visual signal for pneumonia in medical images, automatically locating lung opacities on chest radiographs. That's the plan anyway. 

This project is actually an [open competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge) as of this writing. The deadline for submission is 10/17/2018 whereas the deadline for my capstone is 10/22/18.
